  * The minimum supported Go version has been updated to 1.22. In the new
    version of Go, the default minimum supported TLS version has been changed
    to TLS 1.2.
  * The default value of --strict-config has been changed from false to true.
    If your configuration file uses a non-existent configuration item or has a
    spelling error, the application will throw an error. This startup parameter
    was introduced in version v0.53.0. If you wish to continue using the old
    behavior, you need to explicitly set --strict-config=false.
  * Proxy supports configuring annotations, which will be displayed in the
    frps dashboard.
